# Monthly-Revenue-Uploads

Monthly revenue actuals and the account setup / data load workbooks built from them, organised by fiscal year (July–June).

## Layout

```
FY26/   Jul 2025 – Jun 2026
FY27/   Jul 2026 – Jun 2027
```

Each fiscal year folder contains:

- **`Actual Revenue <Mon> <YY> -unlinked.xlsx`** — the raw monthly actuals extract (one file per month, links removed).
- **`Account_Setup_and_Data_Load_-_PM&C_REV<start>to<end>_Setup.xlsx`** — the setup and data-load workbook covering that month range, built from the monthly actuals. Interim versions from earlier in the year are kept alongside the latest (e.g. FY26 has `...toAPR26`, `...toMAY26`, and the final `...toJUN26`).
- **`Account_Setup_and_Data_Load_-_PM&C_JVREV...`** — the JV revenue exclusion counterpart workbook, where one has been produced.
- **`JV Revenue MDS.xlsx` / `all Revenue MDS.xlsx`** — MDS reference extracts used when building the FY26 workbooks.

## Monthly process

1. Add the new month's `Actual Revenue <Mon> <YY> -unlinked.xlsx` to the fiscal year folder.
2. Extend the year's `Account_Setup_and_Data_Load` workbook to cover the new month (the filename range moves, e.g. `REVJUL26toJUL26` → `REVJUL26toAUG26`).
3. Verify before relying on it: recalculate all formulas (zero errors), and confirm the month's check sheets tie out — every line item OK and the monthly total matching between the revenue sheet and the data load.
